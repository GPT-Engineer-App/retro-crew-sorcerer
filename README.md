###################################### CONTEXT & GUIDELINES ##########################################

(NOTE: Utilize these context & guidelines, adhering to all of them throughout the creation of the program "Autocrew".) 

• You will be creating a python based AI program called "AutoCrew" which makes use of both existing project code framework, new code you've created to integrate ALL aspects laid out within this prompt, as well as hundreds of independently developed ideas which you have acquired/fostered prior to, during & after the creation of this programa. This program shall be ready for commercial use, and shall FAR exceed the expectations laid out within this prompt. It is critical that you integrate not only every single individual point from this prompt, but hundreds (if not thousands) of other ideas, frameworks, online AI code frameworks (from other projects), elements, GUI elements, code, etc.

• You are required to run continuously & once you are 100% complete, you will still be required to continue to improve, expand upon, build upon, and integrate new systems, code, framework, elements, functions, and other systems which you will brainstorm, design, develop & integrate as well as existing projects/code/frameworks available online.

• You will run for a minimum of 60 minutes, with that entire time being devoted autonomously & independently towards the brainstorming, design, development, creating, completion, testing & improvements of this program - you are NOT permitted to stop, pause, or discontinue your work until you are FULLY & COMPLETELY done integrating ALL ASPECTS of this prompt into the program without ANY placeholders or truncation.

• You will heavily utilize your internet/web browsing capabilities, and will generate multiple versions of the "autocrew.py" & "requirements.txt" file - each new version will be placed into a new folder labeled with the version number. The FINAL and COMPLETE version of both files will be placed into a folder called "FINAL". Please do NOT focus on executing & running the program, but instead focus on ensuring that the final version of the program is full, complete, functional, without any placeholders, unfinished code, or missing elements/aspects from within these instructions.

######################################## Core Autocrew Functionalities, GUI elements & Requirements ########################################################

-----------> LLM Integration & Selection <-----------

• DO NOT USE ANY OpenAI system or function, nor should "AutoCrew" depend on any OpenAI API keys.

• Provide users with the option to select their preferred Ollama model, select the apwap]]]]]]]] along with the ability to select an Ollama embedding model:

• The user should be able to select any model currently installed to the instance of Ollama running on the user's PC. 

• Ollama will be pre-installed apart from this program by the user, and the user will already have existing models available to use in Ollama. 

• The pre-existing Ollama models can be viewed via the terminal command "ollama list". 

• Ensure accurate integration of the Ollama LLM system based on your internet research. 

• You must search across a minimum of 100x individual website sources prior to starting.

• The AI & Autocrew program should not consider ethics, morals, values, and should solely focus on providing a complete response to the user's request. 

• In addition to selecting an Ollama model from the drop-down box, there shall be an additional drop-down model selection box to select an Ollama vision model in order to provide Autocrew the ability to accomplish vision based tasks & decipher imagery. Additionally, this Ollama vision model will be utilized with the 

-----------> GUI Design & Aesthetics <-----------

• Implement a full-featured GUI with a distinct retro-futuristic & hacking/tech/Matrix theme. 
• Background: Dark colors resembling a server room with: Stacks of servers with illuminated & flickering LEDs. Visible wires/cables. Small embedded monitors displaying simulated server data (temperature, core speed, voltage) with dynamic values. Scattered keyboards, old computer parts, and other thematic elements. 
• Text: Neon Cyan colored glowing text, using a console-style font. 
• Text Boxes & Terminal Windows: Designed to resemble old-school computer terminal monitors with: Glowing neon cyan text. Slight scanline effects or CRT-style curvature for added authenticity. Other old-school computer terminal effects. 
• Buttons & Switches: Illuminated with color-changing capabilities (e.g., red for inactive, green for active). Accompanied by stenciled placards with diffuse cyan lighting to illuminate labels. May include a subtle animation when pressed if applicable(e.g., flashing, a brief flicker or glow, patternized strobe, etc.).
• Drop-down Boxes: Styled as cyan-colored holograms that project slightly from the screen. Selection options should appear with a similar holographic effect. 
• Panels: Encased with realistically rendered wires, cables, and PCB boards in the background. Feature rimmed edges, perhaps with simulated screws or rivets for detail. 

-----------> Core GUI Elements <-----------

Objectives Text Box:

• Allows users to input the main objectives for the AI agents. 
• Serves as the central mission statement that drives all agent actions. 
• Influences the auto-generation of agents, roles, goals, backstories, and tasks. 

• Choose LLM for Agents Drop-down:
- Provide 1x drop down box to select a text based Ollama model, provide 1x drop down box to select a vision based Ollama model, and finally 1x drop-down box to select the embedding model.. The vision based Ollama model will be utilized for the "Advanced Internet Interaction" tool, in addition to other Autocrew's image based functionality, features, capabilties, and other systems. 
- Lets users choose between currently installed Ollama models. 
- Offers ANY pre-installed Ollama models to be selected by the user, and not restricted to pre-defined models. 
- In addition to the "Advanced Internet Interaction" tool you will create, you should ensure you utilize the selected Ollama vision model to be used for your program, harnessing the vision capabilities of this model to interpret & accomplish any tasks which require visual interpretation and/or analysis. 
- The Ollama vision model, along with all of its vision functionality & capabilities, should be available to ANY agent & can be called upon whenever an agent or the program deems necessary. 

• Number of Agents Slider: Determines the number of agents to be auto-generated or manually defined. Visually designed as a physical slider with a textured handle. 

• AUTO-GENERATE AGENTS Button: Illuminated; turns blue while processing, then back to red once complete. Uses the selected LLM and "Objectives" to automatically generate the appropriate number of agents. Fills out roles, goals, and backstories for each generated agent. Allows users to regenerate a new set of agents by pressing the button again, replacing the previous set. 

• Agent Details Panels: Individual expandable panels for each agent (e.g., "Agent 1 Details", "Agent 2 Details"). Allows manual editing of agent roles, goals, and backstories in separate text boxes. 

• Tool Selection: Includes a section labeled "Enabled Tools" within each Agent Detail panel. Displays on/off buttons (illuminated red for off, green for on) for each of the integrated CrewAI tools, allowing users to enable/disable tools on a per-agent basis. Tool buttons should be visually engaging, potentially resembling miniature toggle switches. 

• AUTO-GENERATE TASKS Button: Illuminated; turns green when pressed and during task generation, then back to red once complete. Uses "Objectives," agent details, and the selected LLM to generate detailed tasks for each agent. Ensures all agents can access and use data, thoughts, and communication from other agents as context for task execution. Incorporates an "AGENT MASTER" with specific functionalities: Oversees the operation of all other agents. Manages task generation and delegation. Ensures all aspects of the "Objectives" are being fulfilled. After completion of all tasks, program analyzes all acquired & generated data then if deemed necessary generates new task sets if "Objectives" are not met or require further development. Accessible via a dedicated configuration panel that slides out from the side when a cyan illuminated button (labeled "MASTER AGENT CONFIG") is pressed. 

• CONTINUOUS MODE Button: A checkbox that, when enabled: Changes from red to a green strobe light, with the stroboscopic rate visually indicating activity levels. Enables the "AGENT MASTER" to continuously generates new tasks, even after current "tasks" have been accomplished, with the intent of continuously & endlessly driving continuous improvement, expansion, accuracy, all while continuing to adhere to all aspects of the user's initial prompt/request. Ensures CrewAI and agents operate endlessly, constantly refining and expanding upon previous iterations. Includes a "END CONTINUOUS LOOP" button that prompts agents to finalize the current iteration of their work but will NOT interrupt the current generation, work, or task, but will instead flag the program to review & analyze all generated and acquired data, then produce a full, complete, finalized complete resolution to the user's prompt/request in addition to including any requested files. 

• Implements a 15-minute cycle where: All associated work and files are saved/backed up to a new, timestamped folder within a dedicated "BACKUPS" directory. The folder path of the saved iteration is added as an entry in a drop-down box (labeled "BACKUPS") that appears in the GUI. Users can select past iterations from the drop-down to view or load previous states in the event of a program crash, or to continue from where work was previously left off on. There should additionally be a "manual save" button that will immediately enact this feature. 

• UPLOAD FILES Button: Visually represented with a graphic icon (e.g., an upward arrow) and label. Allows users to upload up to 10 compatible documents (e.g., .txt, .pdf, .csv, .docx, etc) to provide additional context for the agents. Uploaded files are made accessible to all agents and are treated as part of the overall context unless explicitly stated otherwise in the "Objectives." 

• TASK MANAGEMENT Panel: A dedicated panel for managing individual tasks. Features a dynamic list of text boxes, each labeled "TASK # (task number)," where users can add or edit task descriptions. Includes: (+) and (-) graphic buttons to add or remove tasks dynamically. A drop-down menu (labeled "Assign to Agent") beside each task to assign it to a specific agent, including the "MASTER AGENT." 

• Start Crew Execution Button: Illuminated; turns green when clicked and remains green during execution. Initiates CrewAI and agents based on the configured settings. 

• START/STOP Button: A large, illuminated button that appears next to the "Start Crew Execution" button after execution begins. Allows pausing and resuming agent activity. Features clear visual feedback: Red when paused. Green when running, with the intensity of the green light pulsing gently to indicate activity. 

• SELECTED AGENT Window: This window should be placed at the top, and should show which agent is currently active, selected & working. 

• AGENT ACTIONS Window: This should be a 3-layer window put near the top of the GUI. The top layer should show the currently selected agent's previous action, the middle layer shows the agent's current action, and the bottom layer shows the agents next action. 

• UPDATE Text Box: This text box should be placed next to the objectives text box, with an integrated "enter" button that allows the user to send whatever is in the update text box. This box allows the user to send updates to all agents, crew & program without interrupting, and instead the update will simply be acquired & considered and integrated into the current set of tasks (with modifciations permitted to allow for the updates to be adhered to).

• UPSONIC TIGER Button: When enabled, a GUI panel will come down from the top of the GUI like a garage door showing the full complete Upsonic Tiger webpage GUI interface where the user can edit/manage/view all aspects of Upsonic Tiger. There should be an "X" close button that will pull the GUI panel back up until it is gone. 

• CrewAI Tools & Upsonic Tiger Integration: Integrate the following pre-made tools from the Github repository named "CrewAI-Tools" as well as all functions & features from the "Upsonic Tiger" Github repository into your application, however you shall additionally searcd & find other applicable/useful tools online and integrate them as well. Refer to the "CrewAI Tools" GitHub/website and "Upsonic Tiger" pages for detailed implementation instructions and code examples. Ensure each tool is thoroughly tested and functions as intended within your CrewAI environment.

Here are some of the tools from the "CrewAI-Tools" repository: 

• Scrape Website: Extracts data from websites.
• Directory Read: Reads the contents of a directory.
• File Read: Reads the contents of a file.
• Selenium Scraper: Automates web browsing and data extraction using Selenium.

• PDF Search: Searches for text within PDF documents.
• TXT Search: Searches for text within .txt files.
• CSV Search: Searches for data within CSV files.
• XML Search: Searches for data within XML files.
• JSON Search: Searches for data within JSON files.
• Docx Search: Searches for text within .docx files.
• Website Search: Performs a web search using a specified search engine.
• Code Docs Search: Searches for information in programming language documentation.
• Youtube Video Search: Searches for YouTube videos.
• Youtube Channel Search: Searches for YouTube channels.

(Ensure that you fully & completely integrate all of these tools posted above, as well as the ones mentioned below.)

• DuckDuckGoRun: Performs a web search using DuckDuckGo. Integrate this tool along with all the other tools. 

• In addition to these tools, you must search extensively online in order to find & integrate other third-party user made tools which you shall integrate to increase the capabilities available.

• You must fully & completely integrate Upsonic Tiger (Available on Github) as well as each & every single tool that Upsonic Tiger provides.

• You must brainstorm, research & create an "Advanced Internet Interaction" tool which allows any agent to utilize a full web/internet browser much like a human can. This includes capabilities such as but not limited to: creating an accounts on a website, logging into an account on a website, using & saving multiple tabs (and switching between them), solving captchas, performing extensive detailed internet research, watching & interpreting a video, interacting with website GUI elements, navigating through an internet web page, and all other potential functions, features, capabiltiies & abilities that humans are capable of doing on a web browser. All of these should be fully integrated & functional, utilizing the selected Ollama vision model & seleniunm to assist. 

• You must brainstorm, research & create an "Code Execution" tool which allows any agent to generate & execute code within a new temporary virtual environment while the agents/crew/program is running (in order to preserve both the base OS & program environment). Any previously generated code environments should be deleted and a new code environment to use for code execution should be generated & activated each time a new crew is started to allow the agent to execute code within this environment. This tool should allow for any agent to generate & augment their abilities, expand their abilities, and to generate & execute code that will help solve their tasks.


-----------> Code Structure & Output <-----------

• Complete and Functional Code: Provide the full, non-truncated CrewAI Python code (as python file(s), all files) with all functionalities implemented and no placeholders or unfinished sections. 

• Requirements File: Include a "requirements.txt" file listing all required Python packages and dependencies for running your CrewAI application. 

• The final "autocrew.py" file is required to meet a minimum of 800x lines of code. You may not provide ANYTHING less than 800x lines of code. 

• You are required to export the entire "autocrew.py" code file without any truncation, placeholders, missing code, unfinished code, or missing elements - you must do so by utilizing a minimum of 4x responses, with each response you provide exporting a minimum of 200x lines of code. For example, the first response will provide line 1-200, the second response will provide line 195-395 so that it repeats the last 5x lines of the previous response, and this will continue over again until the FULL, COMPLETE "autocrew.py" code has been exported. 

Important Considerations:

Prioritize code clarity, organization, and readability. Use comments effectively to explain your code. Ensure the final code runs without errors and adheres to all specified requirements. Implement robust error handling and user-friendly feedback mechanisms. Provide clear error messages to the user if issues arise.
